# Layoff Data Analysis

This folder contains two important files for analyzing layoff data:

1. **data_cleaning.sql**: SQL script for cleaning and preparing the layoff data.
2. **exploratory_analysis.sql**: SQL script for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the cleaned data.

These files help in cleaning the data and exploring trends related to layoffs.
